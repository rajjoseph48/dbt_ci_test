## 📋 **Review Checklist for dbt Changes**

### **For Reviewers:**

**✅ Models Built Successfully**
- Check that all expected models were created
- Verify model materialization types (table/view)
- Review timing - unusually slow models may need optimization

**✅ Tests Passed**
- All data quality tests should pass
- Review specific tests that ran
- Check for any newly added tests

**✅ State-Aware Execution**
- Only modified models + downstream should run (not all models)
- Timing should be reasonable for scope of changes

**✅ Schema Isolation**
- Each PR gets unique schema: `pr_123_analytics`
- No conflicts with other PRs or main branch

### **Red Flags to Watch For:**
- ❌ Unexpected models being built (indicates dependency issues)
- ❌ Tests taking too long (performance concerns)
- ❌ New models without tests (data quality concerns)
- ❌ All models running instead of selective (state comparison issues)

## 🎯 **Benefits for Code Review**

### **Transparency**
- **Exact models built**: See which tables/views were created
- **Test coverage**: Verify all tests ran successfully  
- **Performance**: Review execution times
- **Dependencies**: Understand downstream impact

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Data validation**: All tests must pass before merge
- **Regression prevention**: Downstream models are always tested
- **Change verification**: Only intended models are modified

### **Collaboration**
- **Clear feedback**: Detailed logs help identify issues
- **Educational**: Team learns from each other's dbt patterns
- **Confidence**: Reviewers can approve with full visibility

## 🛠 **Advanced Review Techniques**

### **Understanding State Selection**
```
📊 Running modified models and downstream dependencies...
```
**Good**: Only relevant models run
**Concerning**: "running all models" (may indicate state comparison issues)

### **Performance Analysis**
```
⏱️ Completed in 0:00:12.34
```
- **Fast** (< 30s): Good for most changes
- **Moderate** (30s-2m): Acceptable for complex transformations  
- **Slow** (> 2m): May indicate inefficient SQL or missing optimizations

### **Test Pattern Recognition**
```
Tests Executed:
- not_null_stg_customers_customer_id
- unique_stg_customers_customer_id
- relationships_orders_customer_id
```
- **Good**: Tests match model changes
- **Missing**: New models without tests
- **Excessive**: Too many unrelated tests running

## 🔧 **For Developers**

### **Before Creating PR**
1. Run locally: `dbt run --select +my_changed_model+`
2. Test locally: `dbt test --select +my_changed_model+`  
3. Review logs to understand scope

### **Interpreting CI Logs**
- **Models Built**: Should match your expectations
- **Tests Passed**: Should include tests for your changes
- **Timing**: Should be reasonable for scope

### **Common Issues**
- **All models running**: State comparison may not be working
- **Unexpected models**: Check for circular dependencies
- **Tests failing**: Review data quality issues before requesting review

This detailed logging makes the dbt review process transparent and educational for the entire team! 🎯
